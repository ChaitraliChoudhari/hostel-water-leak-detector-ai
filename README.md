# hostel-water-leak-detector-ai
AI-based system to detect water leaks in hostel

## Overview
This project uses AI to detect abnormal water usage patterns in hostels and residential buildings to prevent water wastage.

## Problem Statement
Unnoticed water leaks lead to significant wastage, especially during night hours. Manual monitoring is inefficient.

## Solution
An AI agent learns normal water usage patterns and detects anomalies in real time. Alerts are sent to authorities for quick action.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning (Anomaly Detection)
- Agentic AI Concept
- IBM Granite (Explainability)

## Project Structure
- `data/` – Sample water usage data
- `src/` – AI logic
- `notebook/` – Model demonstration
- `requirements.txt` – Dependencies

## SDG Alignment
- Primary: SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation
- Secondary: SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy

## Future Scope
- IoT sensor integration
- Mobile alert system
